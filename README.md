## Contracts for periodic reward draws on deposit pools in farms

https://github.com/dimdim1177/tezos-pool-games

Full code and documentation of contracts for periodic reward draws on deposit from pools in farms Crunchy or Qupipuswap.
Project developed on Debian 11, not tested in other OS.

The project is NOT COMPLETE, namely:
- scripts for off-chain calling of contract methods are not written
- all tests for CPoolGames not written
- not fully tested
- obviously there are sub-optimalities, because I saw Tezos and PascaLIGO a month ago for the first time

## Getting start

### Install tools

Execute script `./install/install_all.sh` for download and install: LIGO, tezos-client, python, pytezos and so on.
Or execute ./install/install_*.sh scripts for each tool manually.

### Compile

Usage: compile.sh NAME|ALL
Compile 'contracts/NAME.ligo' or 'contracts/*.ligo' for ALL.
Compiled files saved to 'build/NAME.tz' and 'build/NAME.storage.tz' files.

### Tests

Usage: tests.sh NAME|ALL
Execute tests 'tests/NAME.ligo' or 'tests/*.ligo' for ALL.
Logs saved to 'build/NAME.test.log' files.

### Deploy

Usage: deploy.sh NAME|ALL [force]
Deploing 'build/NAME.tz' inited by 'build/NAME.storage.tz' (or 'build/*.tz' for ALL) by account saved as 'owner' in tezos-client.

### Documentation

Firstly, install submodules by `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
Then execute script `./doc/doc.sh` for generate English and Russian documentations for contracts.
Script usage code of subprojects, attached as git submodule:
- https://github.com/dimdim1177/mlcomment Multi-Language comments
- https://github.com/dimdim1177/ligo2dox Convert PascaLIGO to C++ like code for auto-documenting by Doxygen
The html-en and html-ru folders and their contents are generated automatically.

Presentation about the project in text files slides-en/*.slide (all other files in the folder are generated by scripts), the `slides.sh` script generates a video presentation slides-en/video.mp4.

## Contracts

### Contract with pools

See contracts/CPoolGames.ligo and folder contracts/CPoolGames.
Main features:
- Support 2 farms interfaces: Crunchy and QUIPU
- Three algorithms to determine the winner:
    - Probability of win proportional time in current game
    - Probability of win proportional sum of time * deposit in current game
    - Equal probabilities for all users in pool
- Additional pool options:
    - minimal deposit
    - minimal seconds in game
    - maximum deposit (only for algorithm by sum time * deposit)
    - win percent, burn percent, fee percent
    - burn token, fee address
- Flexible code configuration (see contracts/CPoolGames/config.ligo):
    - pool owner/admins or pool as service
    - can enable security transfer tokens (remove operator after transfer)
    - can enable pool statictics in blockchain for promotion
    - can enable pool views for other smart contracts

### Contract for generate random numbers

See contracts/CRandom.ligo and folder contracts/CRandom
Main features:
- Any can request random number in future
- Request has caller address and ID of object
- Random number based on nearest Tezos block hash with time more time in request and XORed with hash of request, that is why one Tezos block generate different random numbers for different requests with the same time.

### Lexem prefixes

- **C** - Contract
- **M** - Module
- **t_** - Type
- **c_** - Constant
- **cERR_** - Constant with error code for failwith
